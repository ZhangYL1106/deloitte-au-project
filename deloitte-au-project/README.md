# Deloitte – Accelerated Underwriting (AU) Project (Summary)

**Goal:** improve **placement rate** → lift issued premium/revenue  
**Two workstreams:**  
1) **Risk-score model** to fast-track low-risk applicants into **AU** (shorter cycle time)  
2) **Cost–benefit model** to optimize **requirement/operational costs** without compromising risk controls

**Stack:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) + Excel · scenario analysis

## What I built
- A **risk score** on synthetic data (EDA → model → thresholding → ROC).
- A **scenario table** comparing requirement sets (fluids vs. EHR) on cost and expected slippage.
- Clear recommendations on where AU makes sense vs. where to keep traditional requirements.

## Quickstart (planned)

## Notes
All datasets are **synthetic/public**. No client or proprietary information.
